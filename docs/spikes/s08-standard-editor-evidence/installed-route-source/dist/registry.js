 * editor / runtime / LSP endpoints by absolute path, and optionally watches the
 * registry file so runtime-port changes push to the bridge without per-RPC I/O.
 *
 * Reading includes deciding whether an entry's owner is still there: the plugin
 * has no reliable liveness signal of its own and prunes nothing, so entries
 * accumulate. That check is delegated to `registryLiveness` — still a read, kept
 * out of here so the socket mechanics don't blur the schema reader.

 * Every editor still credibly claiming a given LSP port — all of them, not just

 *
 * A claimant counts only when it is **pid-alive AND the WS command port its own
 * entry advertises does not refuse a connection**. The PID check comes first
 * because it is free and settles the provably-dead entries; the port probe is what
 * establishes *identity*, since the projection never prunes cross-project entries and
 * they all default to the same engine LSP port — so a stale entry whose recorded
 * PID has been recycled to any unrelated process would otherwise resurrect a
 * closed editor as a rival claimant. An inconclusive probe leaves the claimant
 * counted — `registryLiveness.classifyProbeOutcome` carries why that direction is
 * the safe one. Probes run concurrently, so the added latency is one round trip,
 * not one per candidate.
