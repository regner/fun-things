/**
 * Read the per-instance session token the toolkit published into the registry.
 *
 * The toolkit is authoritative for the token's on-disk LOCATION. At its registry
 * publish sites it globalizes the `user://` token path to an absolute path —
 * honoring `application/config/use_custom_user_dir` live — and writes that into the
 * project's registry entry. This module looks up `entry.token_path`, asserts the
 * published path STRUCTURALLY (absolute, no traversal, the invariant
 * `…/project_instance_<hash>/mcp_token` shape), confirms it is a regular file, and
 * returns its contents. It does NOT re-derive the path: no project-name resolution,
 * no per-OS user-dir reconstruction, no hash recompute.
 *
 * `GODOT_MCP_TOKEN_PATH` is an explicit operator override — a trusted absolute path
 * to an existing file, read directly without the registry or the suffix shape check
 * (it may point anywhere, e.g. a test-harness temp dir).
 *
 * Pure path/filesystem logic — no wire protocol, no channel/auth coupling.
 * `assertPublishedTokenPath` is exported for direct unit testing; the transport
 * imports only `readToken`.
